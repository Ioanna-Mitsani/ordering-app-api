# ordering-app-api
A Node.js + Express.js Server API for exposing data to React food delivery app.

## Description

This project was made to be the final assignment of Web Application course in SAE Athens (November 2021 - January 2022).

This repo consists the server-side part of this exercise (you can find the client-side over here: https://github.com/Ioanna-Mitsani/react-ordering-app). Server-side was made with Node.js + Express.js framework in order to make a basic API setup that exposes data to React client-side. The database used is MongoDB (initially with Robo3T locally, then MongoDB Atlas).

## How to run the app

Download the project folder with code files from main branch. Make sure you have installed npm on your computer. Open folder in IDE, then install the project dependecies with `npm install`. To run the project locally in development mode, hit `npm run dev` and the project will be available to you in localhost:8000 by default.
